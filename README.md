        1. Offline speech recognition using pocketsphinx and Gstreamer     
        2. Natural Language Processing using AIML     
        3. TTS, text-to-speech module     


#### Setup of the "Offline speech recognition" module
Following is the procedure to setup this speech module on an Orange_PI_zero 
running the armbian [debian jessie image](https://www.armbian.com/donate/?f=https://dl.armbian.com/orangepizero/Debian_jessie_default.7z).  
```

    ( preferably in the home directory ~ )     
  2- Edit your Orange_PI_zero username in the system.conf file.     
     using vim or nano editor, open ~/rsai-offline/system.conf. Go to line      
     74 and change 'raouf' with your username.     
  3- Copy the file download the file cmusphinx.tag.gz from      
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzCQYi90icxaZFktcnEwc3Q2NXc/view?usp=sharing      
   in a flash disk and copy it to ~/rsai-offline folder.         
  4- Run the installation script:  ./setup.sh

    all dependencies. At the end of the installation, the system will    
    reboot.
